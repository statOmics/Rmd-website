# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, disp, col = as.factor(cyl))) +
    geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Caching

The GHA workflow maintains cached *knitr* results between subsequent runs to
reduce runtime. Caching can be enabled by specifying `cache=TRUE` in the code
chunk header.

__Note that this should be used with caution, as caches may become invalid when code is changed, potentially leading to unsuspected results.__

```{r, cache=TRUE}
## Run with caching enabled
Sys.time()
```
